            <h2>Chicken</h2>
            <p>A chicken is a domesticated bird commonly raised on farms for its meat and eggs, known for its
                characteristic clucking sounds and often having a variety of colors like white, brown, or black; male
                chickens are called roosters and are larger with more vibrant plumage, while females are called hens and
                lay eggs; both sexes have fleshy skin folds on their heads called combs and wattles, and they are social
                animals living in flocks with a pecking order hierarchy to establish dominance; chickens are omnivores,
                foraging for food by scratching the ground with their feet, and are unable to fly long distances due to
                their relatively heavy bodies and short wings</p>

            <h2>Beef</h2>
            <p>
                Beef cattle are cattle raised for meat production (as distinguished from dairy cattle, used for milk
                production). The meat of mature or almost mature cattle is mostly known as beef. In beef production
                there are three main stages: cow-calf operations, backgrounding, and feedlot operations.</p>

        <div class="menu-item" id="sushi">
            <h2>Sushi</h2>
            <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish consisting of seasoned vinegared rice, usually topped with raw
                seafood, vegetables, or cooked egg, and often wrapped in a sheet of seaweed (nori), making it a popular
                food that features the rice as the main component, not just the raw fish as many people might think; the
                word "sushi" itself translates to "sour rice" due to the vinegar used in the rice preparation.</p>
